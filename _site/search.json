Read this guide then contact tbats for entry.\r\nSteps for posting spots in your GBs\r\nCalculate the amount of forge points (fps) necessary to lock the desired number of spots on your Great Building (GB). There are two options:\r\nDo the math. The owner “locks” a particular spot by adding fps until the remaining number of fps needed to level the GB is twice the reward (includes contributor Arc bonus) a contributor will receive for taking that spot.\r\nExample:\r\nYou want to post the 3rd spot in your GB in the 1.9 thread, and the current number of fps required to level that GB is 350 fps. You calculate contributor reward for taking the 3rd spot to be 100 fps (1.9 x base reward = 1.9 x 53 approx.).\r\nTo lock the 3rd spot, you calculate that you need to add 150 fps to the GB. Now, when a contributor adds 100 fps to take the 3rd spot, it leaves 100 fps to level the GB (350 - 100 - x = 100   =>   350 - 100 - 100 = x   =>   x = 150). You add 150 fps.\r\nThe contributor adds the 100 fp and has the 3rd spot locked. Nobody can add 101 fps to the GB and take 3rd from the contributor. (Note: If the value you or the contributor would have to contribute is not a round number, then round up or a sniper will be able to steal the position by adding 1 more fp than the contributor).\r\n\r\n\r\nUse FOE tools (link). Steps:\r\nClick on your GB from the list\r\nEnter the Arc bonus (90 for using the 1.9 thread and 80 for the 1.8 thread) under “% of global investors bonus (arc bonus)”\r\nRead the table below to find out how many total fps you (owner) need to add to lock each spot (amounts are cumulative).\r\nAdd the appropriate amount of fp to your GB according to which spots you want to lock.\r\nClick the check boxes on the right side of the table according to which spots you have locked.\r\nUnder Promotion Message, type your name into the Prefix box\r\nMake sure that “Display GB name” is set to “yes”\r\nClick the copy button for one of the promotion messages (options 1 or 4 is recommended)\r\n\r\n\r\nPost a message in the 1.8 or 1.9 thread that includes your name, the GB, and the spots you have locked and want taken.\r\nAdd the necessary fps to your GB before posting in the thread.  If you don’t add the necessary fp before the contributor takes the spot, then they may lose their position to a sniper.\r\nMake sure the level for your GB is unlocked before you post it.  If you are adding fps, this is automatic. At higher levels, you may not need to add fps in order to lock spots, and it’s easy to just post the building without unlocking the level first.\r\nPost your GBs at the bottom of the list of GBs already in the thread. The longer a GB is in the thread, the greater the risk it will be sniped. Keeping the posting order intact allows guildmates to prioritize those GBs at the greatest risk.\r\n\r\nTaking spots in others’ GBs\r\nTake spots in order - (e.g. taking the third spot before the second spot has been taken) Taking a spot out of order can lead to the untaken spot being sniped.\r\nExample:\r\nAn owner is leveling Cape Canaveral to level 25 (total cost, 1275) and has locked the first three spots by adding 239 fp.\r\nThe first spot is taken by someone for 561 fp and the third spot is taken for 95 fp\r\nThe second spot should cost 285 fp but is now capable of being sniped for 190 fp ( (1275 - 239 - 561 - 95) / 2 )\r\n\r\nIf there is just one offer with one position up:\r\n1. Post the message, “clear”\r\n2. Add the appropriate number of fps to the building\r\nIf there is more than one offer, and you take all the offers:\r\n1. Post the message, “clear”\r\n2. Add the appropriate number of fps to all the GBs\r\nIf there is more than one offer, and you only take some of the offers:\r\n1. Copy the all the offers of the original message to a new message.\r\n2. Delete whatever position(s) that you are taking in the new message.\r\n3. Post the updated new message and add your fps to the appropriate GB(s)\r\nIf you are both taking offers and posting spots for your GB:\r\n1. Copy the all the offers of the original message to a new message.\r\n2. Delete whatever position(s) that you are taking in the new message.\r\n3. Add your GB offer to the bottom of the new message.\r\n4. Post the updated new message and add your fps to the appropriate GB(s)\r\nTips/Best Practices (Not requirements)\r\nLock 2 spots or fewer at a time\r\nLocking more than two spots at a time increases your likelihood of getting sniped and having to add extra fps to lock the next position.\r\n\r\nOnly unlock levels that you want to currently add fp to.\r\nUnlocking levels of your GB that you don’t plan on leveling immediately increases your likelihood of getting sniped. This is especially important when you reach levels at which no contribution is required on your part to lock the first few spots on your GB.\r\n\r\nAdd the amounts of fp for spots in your message\r\nAdding amounts reduces the risk of mistakes and reduces the effort for contributors, especially those with Arcs over level 80.\r\n\r\nTake all available spots\r\nThe goal is for everyone to take every open spot that’s available to them. This reduces the risk of the owner getting sniped and speeds the game along by enabling the owner to level their GBs as quickly as possible.\r\nIf you can’t take all available spots, the next best thing would be to try to take as many spots as you post. Anyone expecting help with their GBs should be willing to help others.\r\nGBs at the top of the list are top priority. If you can’t take the spots of the GB(s) at the top of the list, the next level priority are GBs with 4th and 5th spots open.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
